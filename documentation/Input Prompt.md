We have an app called Identity Matrix that de-anonymizes the traffic of our client's website. Knowing exactly who the visitor is.

The current project should create a website in React.JS to show the visitors (leads) tracked and a few other features User Account, Company Team, Integrations, etc.

Things to consider when developing the project:

\- We should use Redux to make API calls to our backend.

\- Use react-router-dom to make the routes

\- The primary color of our website is `#813efb`

\- We want the option of switching from a dark to a light theme. The default is a dark theme.

We gonna need these pages in this first version:

\- Login

\- Sign Up

\- Pricing

\- Pulse page (it contains a list of all the visitors tracked from the client's website)

\- Integrations (a list with all CRMs available that the users want to integrate)

\- User Settings (the user can change things like Name, Email, Password)

1. - Company Team (it contains a list of all the team members from the company)
